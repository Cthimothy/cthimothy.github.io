When I started my new role, I was provided with a Macbook Pro M3. Until then I had
used various flavours of Linux on my laptop and desktops for decades. I have been 
using Arc as a browser for about a year now, and despite aspects of it which I 
thoroughly dislike, I have integrated a specific aspect of it in to my daily workflow
which I will find very difficult to leave behind; which is why I am so 
disappointed that, as Arc is built on Chromium, adblocking will become
problematic in the near future.


I speng large chunks of my life in Emacs. I use it for everything other than web
browsing and email. A close second though, is Raycast which I customise with 
various shortcuts, including one that I use about a million times a
day: open a DuckDuckGo search dialog, which then opens an Arc mini-browser
window in the current desktop.

I use this so often that I cannot work without it. I'll probably need to
ditch Arc in the near future, but until something like Zen provides a similar
feature, I'm stuck.
