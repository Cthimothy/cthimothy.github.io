# Work
I am a Linux Infrastructure guy (in the Paleozoic Era, we were called Unix SysAdmins).
I work at the University of Exeter (Devon, UK) as a team lead for [Project ADA](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/projectada) (AI and Data Science).

I worship daily at the Church of Emacs, which is my daily driver for much of my work fnord; 
coding, remote server and container admin, notes, journals and PKM, project and task 
management, blog reading and writing, etc.

Since my early teens, I've been a massive H. P. Lovecraft fan. When I first started reading his stories, in my head I pronounced
His Name as Kuh-Too-Loo, which is why I used Cthimothy (Kuh-Timothy) as an online name (no-one does that these days, so they?).
